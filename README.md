Made for a Travel agency in Beijing but it did't visit any server 

> TreckTrack was the name of the project

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
